 * PROVENANCE: mixed, and the difference is marked per field.
 *
 * The header parse is TRANSCRIBED from image 0x036B6 and checked against the
 * original by tools/verify_level.py, which stops it after the parse and
 * compares the globals it filled in with what this code produces from the same
 * 2048 bytes. The terrain entry decode is transcribed from image 0x07C90.
 * Everything else - the object table, the steel table, the level name - is
 * still written from the published .LVL description at camanis.net, checked
 * field by field against level000.dat rather than trusted, and NOT yet checked
 * against the original. See STATUS.md.
 *
 * Every multi-byte field is BIG-endian: the game came from the Amiga and the
 * data files were not rewritten for the PC. Reading level 1 little-endian
 * gives 12800 lemmings and a release rate of 12800; big-endian gives 80
 * lemmings, rescue 40, release rate 50, which is the level as published.
 *
 * The terrain entry's packing is the one part the published description does
 * not draw out, and its worked examples cannot all be reconciled with a
 * single reading. What is implemented here was chosen by decoding all 168
 * entries of level 1 both plausible ways and keeping the one where every
 * entry lands in range and names a terrain id that ground0o.dat actually
 * defines: 168/168 against 82/168.
